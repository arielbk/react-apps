# React Apps Playground

This is for any small React apps that I make.

## Date Facts App

This app allows the user to select a date, and returns a fact for that date. It uses the Numbers API (http://numbersapi.com/).

## Word Counter App

This app counts the frequency of each word entered into a text box. It's fast, but it struggles once you try to paste in Crime and Punishment..
